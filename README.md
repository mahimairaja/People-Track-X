People Track-X is an advanced computer vision solution designed to address crowd detection and people counting challenges. Leveraging the power of YOLOv8 and ByteTracker algorithms, this innovative system accurately analyzes video streams from specific cameras to provide real-time insights into crowd dynamics. The system is designed to work seamlessly with existing camera infrastructure, enabling easy deployment and integration into surveillance systems

## Quick Start üöÄ :

### Method 01 - Using `virtual environment` üì¶

1) Clone the Repository [People-Track-X](https://github.com/mahimairaja/People-Track-X)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mahimairaja/People-Track-X.git

cd People-Track-X
```

2) Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv env
```
   
3) Activate the virtual environment (Run according to your system)
```bash
source env/bin/activate 
# This is for linux or mac OS

.\env\Script\activate  
# This is for windows OS
```

3) Install the dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4) Run the streamlit app
```bash
cd app

streamlit run app.py
```

### Method 02 - Using `Docker container üö¢` 

1) Clone the Repository [People-Track-X](https://github.com/mahimairaja/People-Track-X)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mahimairaja/People-Track-X.git

cd People-Track-X
```

2) Build the container

```bash
docker build -t people-track-x .
```

2) Execute the container

```bash
docker run -p 8501:8501 people-track-x
```
